# Bisection method and Newton's method

This is a program that implements the Bisection method and the Newton method to
find the roots of mathematical functions. The mathematical functions are hard coded
in this program.

## ----------------- Newton's method -----------------------
Newton's method is an algorithm to find the approximate solution to *f(x) = 0*

The method begins with an initial guess x<sub>0</sub>
